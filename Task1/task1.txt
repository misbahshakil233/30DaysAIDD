### 1️⃣ What I Learned Today

- AI-Driven Development (AIDD) means developers are now collaborating with AI systems, not just writing code manually.  
- The **October 2025 AI Turning Point** made AI-assisted development mainstream.  
- Developers now focus on **reasoning, evaluation, and strategy**, not just syntax.  
- AI tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude can now assist in planning, coding, and testing.  
- **Evaluation-Driven Development (EvDD)** helps improve AI outputs.  
- Productivity has increased 5–10× due to AI coding agents.

### 2️⃣ My Personal Reflection

> “Today I learned that AI isn’t replacing developers — it’s redefining them. The 2025 Turning Point proved that coding is no longer just syntax; it’s about reasoning, collaboration, and strategy.”

- I feel AI will help me focus more on creative problem-solving.  
- In the future, Human-AI collaboration will be a core skill for developers.  
- I plan to document and track my learning using Git and VS Code for hands-on practice.
